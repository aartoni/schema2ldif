  eventually write back to you as it just means we are away from keyboard,
  working on something else, or in a different timezone than you.

* You should treat IRC as what it is: asynchronous chat.  Sure the messages can
  be instant but in most channels people are in different time zones.  At times
  chat replies can be in excess of 24hrs.
